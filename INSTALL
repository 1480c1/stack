To build STACK from source code, you need the development version of
Clang and LLVM, as detailed at:

	http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html

We use the following parameters to LLVM's configure:

	--enable-cxx11 --enable-targets=host --enable-bindings=none --enable-shared --enable-debug-symbols --enable-optimized

If you prefer to install Clang and LLVM in a directory other than
/usr/local, also pass --prefix=... to its configure, and add that
directory to your PATH.

Then run in the LLVM build directory:

	$ make install

This will install Clang and LLVM.

Then build STACK in its source root directory.

If building from git, first do:

	$ autoreconf -fvi

If building from a source tarball, skip the above step.

Then configure and make.

	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ ../configure
	$ make

Finally, add `<STACK_ROOT>/build/bin` to PATH.
