See INSTALL for build instructions or download prebuilt binaries.
Make sure Kint binaries are in the PATH.


Preparation
-----------

Kint works on LLVM bitcode.  To analyze a software project, the
first step is to generate LLVM bitcode.  Kint provides a script
called `kint-build`, which both calls gcc (or g++) and in parallel
uses Clang to obtain LLVM bitcode from your source code, stored in
.ll files. For example:

	$ cd /path/to/your/project
	$ kint-build make


Unstable code checker
---------------------

To find unstable code that can be eliminated due to undefined behavior,
simply run the following command in the project directory after building
LLVM bitcode:

	$ poptck

You can find bug reports in `poptck.txt`.
